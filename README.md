# IR codes from remote of Dual TV (DL-TQL32R1-002)

## General
This IR codes are extracted from remote (as shown on the photo below) of a Dual DL-TQL32R1-002 TV. I have tested them succesfully. The codes might be compatible with other Dual TV devices.

> **Note**: If you are searching for other IR codes check out [probonopd/irdb](https://github.com/probonopd/irdb).

## Used hardware/software
On 29 April 2020, I have extracted these 51 IR codes using the BroadLink Universal Remote (RM mini 3) hardware in combination with [brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker](https://github.com/brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker) software. The remote used is the original remote of a DL-TQL32R1-002 Dual TV.

> _**Note:** Only the S-mode button on the right bottom of the remote is missing, it didn't work. I am not sure if it is suppose to work in the first place, or just broken on the used remote._


_If you also own a BroadLink Universal Remote, the files from the command folder can be imported into the local `commands` folder of the [brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo](https://github.com/rob121/broadlinkgo) or [brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker](https://github.com/brianpierson2020/broadlinkgo-docker) software._

## Conversion
The codes can also probably be converted for use with other hardware/software and to other file formats using software like [IrScrutinizer](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer) or [MakeHex](https://github.com/probonopd/MakeHex) but I didn't try that yet. _If you do, please send a PR so we can keep it all in one place._
